# Win-M++ â€” an upgraded version of Win+M shortcut for multiple displays, version 3

This is pretty much my attempt to rewrite [previous version of the app](https://github.com/bnfour/winmplusplus) in accordance with SOLID principles I was told about in the meantime.

## Usage

**Win+M:** minimize windows on display the currently focused window is on;

**Win+Shift+M:** minimize all windows on all displays, as without this app.

## Configuration

Autostart on system startup may be set on and off from app's tray menu.  
Doubleclick on the icon or "Enable" checkbox in the tray menu toggles functioning.

### Advanced

File `exceptions.txt` contains list of window titles not to minimize ever. Default entries tested to work on English versions of Windows 7 and Windows 10. Additional entries may be added if necessary.
