# Win-M++ â€” an upgraded version of Win+M shortcut for multiple displays, version 3

Usage:

* **Win+M:** minimize windows on display the currently focused window is on;
* **Win+Shift+M:** minimize all windows on all displays, as without this app;

This is pretty much my attempt to rewrite [previous version of the app](https://github.com/bnfour/winmplusplus) in accordance with SOLID principles I was told about in the meantime.

Configurable via tray icon, as shown here:
