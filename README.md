# Win-M++ â€” an upgraded version of Win+M shortcut for multiple displays, version 3

**In (lazy) development right now, if you want working stuff, check out [previous version of the app](https://github.com/bnfour/winmplusplus).**

Usage:

* **Win+M:** minimize windows on display the currently focused window is on;
* **Win+Shift+M:** minimize all windows on all displays, as without this app;

This is pretty much my attempt to write readable code in accordance with SOLID principles I was told about in the meantime.

Configurable via tray icon, as shown here, temprorary screenshot from version 2:
